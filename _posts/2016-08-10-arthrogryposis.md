  Arthrogryposis (arth-ro-grip-OH-sis) means a child is born with joint
  contractures. This means some of their joints don't move as much as normal and
  may even be stuck in one position. Often the muscles around these joints are
  thin, weak, stiff or missing. Extra tissue may have formed around the joints,
  holding them in place.
