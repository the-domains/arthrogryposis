  The most common universal symptom of AMC is limited or absent movement around
  small and large joints (contractures). The contractures are present at birth
  (congenital). The muscles of the affected limbs may be underdeveloped
  (hypoplastic), resulting in a tube-shaped limb with a soft, doughy feeling.
  Soft tissue webbing may develop over the affected joints.
